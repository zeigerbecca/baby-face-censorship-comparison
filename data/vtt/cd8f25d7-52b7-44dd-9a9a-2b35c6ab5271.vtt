00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
That's what makes me mad with you.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
You're a coward.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
I mean it. 

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
You let life defeat you

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
You don't fight back.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
(What chance has a woman got?)

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
More chance than men. 

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
A woman young, beautiful like you are can get anything she wants in the world. 

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
But there is a right and a wrong way.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Remember the price of the wrong way is too great. 

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Go to some big city where you will find opportunities!

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Don't let people mislead you.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
You must be a master, not a slave.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Be clean!

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Be strong!

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Defiant!

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And you will be a success.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Dear Lilly,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:27.000
From your letters, I can tell that my advice to you was for nothing. 

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:27.000
You have chosen the wrong way.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:27.000
You are still a coward.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Life will defeat you unless you fight back and regain your self respect. 

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000
I send you this book, hoping that you will allow it to guide you right.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Merry Christmas.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.000
