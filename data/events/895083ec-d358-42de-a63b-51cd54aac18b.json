The film stars Barbara Stanwyck, whose persona embodied a sparky, brassy audacity emblematic of more sexually liberated images women depicted in this era alongside the curvaceous assertiveness of Mae West and the cool androgyny of Marlene Dietrich, than would be allowed for the next two decades to come. The theatrical version of "

However, in 2004, Mike Mashon, a then a curator of the motion picture division at the Library of Congress, found a duplicate negative of the film that was a bit longer than the original camera negative. He soon discovered that this uncut version, was rejected by the New York State censorship board for how non-judgmental it is towards the protagonists actions. Most notably an elderly cobbler, her caring but stern confidant, who was altered to be the film's moral voice, was originally a Nietzschean disciple who actually was the source of her philosophical encouragement to use men to get what she wants instead of letting them use her. In the peak popularity of DVDs in the early 2000s, uncensored versions of pre-Code films were restored and released alongside theatrical versions. When the streaming (VOD) era soon gained popularity in the mid 2000s and shortly thereafter overtook physical media altogether, teams from those companies pulled the best digitally restored masters available, which in the case of a film like "

Watching the uncensored version was shocking to me in its frankness and sexual agency allowed to its main character, as it would likely be to most other contemporary viewers. But to fully appreciate its transgressive power, one must be able to compare what audiences at the time saw, and were likely still titillated by in the theatrical version. It is my hope that by presenting two short equivalent scenes from each version to compare side by side, individuals interested in pre-Code film can have concrete evidence of "
